## Important Notes
The code that was used for this mod, excluding the JSON files that were used for the models, are under the MIT license. The art is also not covered by the MIT license. Kai1907 and SeaOfPixels gave explicit permission to use their art for this project. The initial JSON files for the models were created by Kai1907 using BlockBench and some of them were tweaked by me to make sure that they worked with the mod. The current models were mostly created by SeaOfPixels with some placeholders made by me until they can be replaced by SeaOfPixel's models.
